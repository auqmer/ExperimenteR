## Omnibus vs. Pairwise Tests

* The F-test is an omnibus test â€“ it tests for overall differences among the groups.
* We are often interested in knowing specifically which groups are different from one another. This requires pairwise comparisons.
* We can do this in one of two ways:
    - Post-hoc comparisons: 
        + We analyze all possible pairwise combinations after the fact.
        + We do this when we have no theoretically specified comparisons, and are simply interested in where differences exist.
    - A priori comparisons:
        + We specify specific comparisons before the fact.
        + We do this when we have theoretically or empirically derived comparisons in which we are specifically interested.
        
## Post-hoc Tests {.smaller}

* There are three tests in popular use (because they can accommodate unequal samples):
    - Tukey (most liberal)
    - Scheffe (most conservative)
    - Bonferonni (somewhere in the middle)
* Which test should you use?
    - Use Tukey in more exploratory situations, because it is less conservative, and therefore has the most power.
    - Use Scheffe to be conservative, to minimize risk of Type I error.
    - Use Bonferonni if you want to be halfway between risky but powerful and low-risk of Type I. It is moderately conservative, thus giving somewhat higher power than Scheffe.
    - Scheffe is probably most popular, but sometimes people prefer Tukey because of the higher probability of finding a significant difference.


##  Post-Hoc Comparisons

## Pairwise Comparisons

It is important to control the **experimentwise alpha** so that the probabilty of rejecting the null, assuming the null is true is equal to or less than the pre-established alpha level (e.g. $\alpha = .05$).

## Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) Test

Fisher's LSD is the most liberal post-hoc test generally accepted in published research.

$$
\text{Fisher's LSD}:  t_\alpha \sqrt{MS_E \bigg( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}\bigg)},
$$

where $t_\alpha$ is the critical value for a two-tailed *t* test at $\alpha = .05$.



## Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) Test

Tukey's HSD is more conservative than Fisher's LSD.

$$
\text{Tukey's HSD}: q_\alpha \sqrt{\frac{MS_E}{n}},
$$

where $q_\alpha$ is the **studentized range statistics**.

## Scheffe
